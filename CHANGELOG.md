# CHANGELOG

- [Feature] `trusttunnel_endpoint -c` can now generate `client_random_prefix` values automatically, append matching allow rules to `rules.toml`, and embed the generated value into exported client configs.

## 1.0.17

- [Fix]     Reverse proxy routing for H2/H3.
- [Feature] Add `ping_enable`, `ping_path`, `speedtest_enable` and `speedtest_path` config keys to configure ping and speedtest handlers.
- [Feature] Add `auth_failure_status_code` config key to control the HTTP status code returned on authentication failure (407 or 405). Defaults to 407.

## 1.0.16

- [Fix] HTTP/1.1 codec busy loop when receiving partial request headers.

## 1.0.13

- [Fix] Change deep-link format from `tt://` to `tt://?`. For backward compatibility, `tt://` is still supported.

## 1.0.11

- [Security] Fixed traffic leaking to local network via UDP, ICMP, and SOCKS5 forwarders
  when `allow_private_network_connections` is set to `false`.
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to UDP forwarder
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to ICMP forwarder
    - Added `is_global_ip` check to SOCKS5 forwarder (TCP and UDP)
    - Handle IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (`::ffff:x.x.x.x`) in `is_global_ip`
  (Based on [GitHub PR #79](https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/pull/79) by @andrew-morris)

## 1.0.7

- [Feature] Added per-client connection limits
    - Optional limits for simultaneous HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections per client credentials
    - Global default limits via `default_max_http2_conns_per_client` and `default_max_http3_conns_per_client` in main config
    - Per-client overrides via `max_http2_conns` and `max_http3_conns` in credentials file
    - Applies to both SNI-authenticated and proxy-basic authenticated connections
    - For proxy-basic: limit enforced on first authenticated request (not idle connections)

  API changes in the library:
    - Added `max_http2_conns` and `max_http3_conns` fields to `authentication::registry_based::Client`
    - Added `default_max_http2_conns_per_client` and `default_max_http3_conns_per_client` fields to `settings::Settings`

## 1.0.6

Added support for X25519MLKEM768 post-quantum group.

## 1.0.5

- [Feature] The `-a` flag now accepts `domain` and `domain:port` in addition to `ip` and `ip:port`.
  The exported client configuration will contain the domain name, which the client resolves via DNS at connect time.
- [Feature] Deep-link format (`tt://`) now supports domain names in the `addresses` field.
- [Feature] When listening on `[::]`, the endpoint now explicitly sets `IPV6_V6ONLY=false` to accept
  both IPv4 and IPv6 connections on a single socket (dual-stack).

## 1.0.1

- [Feature] Added new `trusttunnel-deeplink` library crate for encoding/decoding `tt://` URIs
- [Feature] Added `client_random_prefix` field to client configuration export
    - New CLI option `--client-random-prefix`
    - Validates hex format and checks against `rules.toml`
    - Added to deep-link format as tag 0x0B

## 0.9.115

- Fixed an issue where `client_random_prefix` rules didn’t match when Anti-DPI or post-quantum cryptography was enabled.
  (https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/security/advisories/GHSA-fqh7-r5gf-3r87)

## 0.9.114

- Fixed an issue where `allow_private_network_connections` set to false could be bypassed
when a numeric address was used.
  (https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/security/advisories/GHSA-hgr9-frvw-5r76)

## 0.9.87

- Added automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation to `setup_wizard`

  API changes in the library:
    - `tunnel_tls_hosts`, `ping_tls_hosts` and `speed_tls_hosts` from `settings::Settings`,
      and `tls_hosts` from `settings::ReverseProxySettings` were extracted into a dedicated
      structure `settings::TlsHostsSettings`
    - Added a new method for the reloading settings: `core::Core::reload_tls_hosts_settings()`

  The executable related changes:
    - The TLS hosts settings must be passed as a separate argument ([see here](./README.md#running) for details)
    - The new settings file structures are described ([see here](./README.md#library-configuration))
    - The executable is now handling the SIGHUP signal to trigger the reloading
      ([see here](./README.md#dynamic-reloading-of-tls-hosts-settings) for details)
